This is basically what we did in lectures 5-7 to generate our design matrix $\\Phi$.  The difference is that in our lectures we used powers of $x$ exclusively, where as below I would like you to use at least two non-polynomial functions of $x$.  You can use any functions you want; consider trigonometric functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, radial basis function (Gaussians), etc.  The only functions you are forbidden to use are functions generating a sigmoid such as the one generating the synthetic data for this problem (this includes the arctangent function)!  It is recommended, but not required, that one of your features is an intercept term (all 1's).\n",

    "#### Problem 2: Gradient Descent (20 points)\n",
    "The basic idea behind [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) is that you can minimize a parametrized function by simply taking small steps in the negative direction of the derivative of the function.  I'm not going to go into too many details here, since [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) does such a good job.  Also see [Andrew Ng's class notes](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Generalized-Linear-Models-[Andrew-Ng].pdf) on the topic for a more thorough mathematical treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our cases, we are interesting in minimizing the square error in our linear approximation with respect to our training data.  That is, we want to minimize\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "     & \\sum_{i=0}^n (\\hat{f}(x_i) - y_i)^2 \\\\\n",
    "   = & \\sum_{i=0}^n (\\phi_0(x_i) w_0 + \\phi_1(x_i) w_1 + \\dots + \\phi_k(x_i) w_k - y_i)^2 \\\\ \n",
    "   = & \\|\\Phi w - \\textbf{y}\\|^2 \n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all of our training data (the $x_i$ and $y_i$ terms) are known, the only variables we can optimize on are the $w$ variables. The gradient is (skipping over a *lot* of linear algebra):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "       & \\nabla \\|\\Phi w - \\textbf{y}\\|^2  \\\\\n",
    "     = & \\Phi^T (\\Phi w - \\textbf{y})\n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm asks us, then, to start with some guess for $\\textbf{w}$ and repeatedly subtract some small multiple of the gradient from it, until $\\textbf{w}$ converges:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{w'} = \\textbf{w} + \\alpha \\Phi^T (\\textbf{y} - \\Phi \\textbf{w}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence is a somewhat tricky issue, and the step size $\\alpha$ is a key to getting good convergence; a large $\\alpha$ speeds up the algorithm, but can miss the optimum by stepping too far (and can even diverge); a small $\\alpha$ may result in a better optimum, but at the cost of speed.  You may have to play around a bit with different values for $\\alpha$ until you get a good result; print out the norm of the change in `w` at each step to see if you are converging or diverging, or put in an `if` statement to kill the function when the norm starts growing large.  In testing this assignment, I found I had to use a pretty small $\\alpha$ to prevent divergence; 0.00001 worked for me.  However, you will get different results depending on your features.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you will write a function `lr` which takes in $\\Phi$ (generated by your `phi` function above applied to `trainX`) and $y$ (`trainY`) and returns a vector `w` computed by gradient descent.  It is easiest to start `w` at the zero vector and go from there; as we already said, use $\\alpha = 0.1$.  Stop training when the norm of the change in `w` is less than 1e-6 (the norm of a vector is the square root of the dot product of the vector with itself) or in any case after 100,000 steps have been taken.  Before returning, your function should print out the number of iterations (gradient descent steps) taken."

This can be accomplished using `plt.plot(...)`, following the examples in the lectures.  Don't forget you can also look at the matplotlib documentation - there's a link under the Help menu in your notebook.

If the values are roughly equally distributed above and below the $x$ axis, then our approximation was probably pretty good.\n",
