\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

A NaI(Tl) scintillation detector was used in recording $\gamma$ emissions produced by $^{137}$Cs and $^{60}$Co. Other Things occurred. Some results were found with $\pm$ errors.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Some things were important to introduce the reader on about this lab.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 A cool figure (Figure \ref{fig:Scint}).

\end{figure}

Yet another! (Figure \ref{fig:PMT}) This is getting interesting now. Really hooking the reader on your lab report.

\section{Data Collection}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You might have used the MAESTRO\textsuperscript{\textregistered} software.

\section{Data Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Signals rise time was $\approx$20 $\unit{{\mu}s}$ and a fall time that is large comparatively at $\approx$300 $\unit{{\mu}s}$. Some data tables might look like:


\begin{table*}[h]
\begin{center}
\small{ 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
%\multicolumn{6}{|c|}{A nice title} \\\hline
Source                             & Energy (keV)        & Peak (bin)        & Fit FWHM (bin) & Net Area (bin) & Net Count Rate (s)  \\\hline
\tiny{$^{137}$Cs}                  &  661.657$\pm$0.0003 & 1$\pm$1   & 1 & 1$\pm$1 & 1 \\\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{\tiny{$^{60}$Co}}  & 1173.228$\pm$0.0003 & 1$\pm$1 & 1 &  1$\pm$1 & 1 \\\cline{2-6}
                                   & 1332.492$\pm$0.0004 & 1$\pm$1 & 1 &  1$\pm$1 & 1 \\\hline
\tiny{$^{40}$K}                    & 1460.822$\pm$0.0006 & 1$\pm$1 &  1 &      1$\pm$1 & 1 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\caption{Spectral information from MAESTRO\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. Energy from \cite{bib:nuclear}}
\end{center}
\end{table*}

A fancy equation:

\begin{equation}
 Energy= m x + B
\end{equation}


You probably will use \cite{bib:error} to do some error analysis.

\caption{$r^{-1}$=Blue,$r^{-2}$=Green, $r^{-3}$=Red, $r^{-?}$ , Data=Blue points}
